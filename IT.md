I don't think I've ever met anyone who's made it through a white-collar existence without at least one or two frustrating exchanges with a corporate IT department. If you work for a large- or even small- company, you likely have a staff of folks who keep the network running and handle software requests from every user in the company. To ensure that your company's network is free from malicious attack or well-intentioned, but careless or imperfect users, most computers have sensitive areas restricted. This means that if you want to install software, you need an administrator to do it for you.

The first thing to bear in mind is that, despite any appearance to the contrary, your IT staff is there to help you. Moreover, they're people. They have families who love them and lives outside of work. They have to deal with ridiculous hours to accommodate you and they get far more complaints than they do praise. Be nice to them and you may be surprised how supportive they can be.

All clear? With that understood, there are several situations you may find yourself in. 

## You have admin rights to your computer

Lucky you. Actually, lucky me as this is the happy situation that I enjoy. How do you handle this situation? Don't blow it! Be careful what you download, don't greedily consume bandwidth, server space or any of your company's other scarce resources and be VERY NICE to your IT staff. Acknowledge that you're grateful to have been given such trust and pledge not to do anything to have it removed.

## You don't have admin rights to your computer

What to do? Request to be given admin rights. Explain why, in detail. Don't be evasive or vague. Present a strong business case for why use of this software will permit you and your department to work more efficiently. Show them this book and underline the parts where I tell folk to be nice and respectful towards IT staff.

## IT won't give you admin rights to your computer

In this case, you may ask them to install it for you. Pool your resources. Talk to other actuaries and analysts in your company. Talk to your boss.

## IT won't install the software.

Solution? Install the software to a memory stick. Yes, it is often (but not always!) possible to do this. This is is obviously not a preferred option, but it will get you up and running and enable you to attend the workshop.

## Memory sticks are locked down

In this case, your IT department really wants you all to be running terminals. OK. Suggest an install of RStudio Server. This enables R to run on a server with controlled user access. This is quite a lot more work for your IT staff and you'll need to make a strong use case for it. If you're a large organization which has a predictive modelling or analytics area, they'll likely want this software. This won't allow you to use R remotely, so getting the most out of the workshop will be tough. However, there's still one more option.

## The nuclear option

Your IT staff won't run R on a server, won't give you a laptop with R installed. They're really against this software. I'd like to advise you to get another job, but that's defeatist. This is where we reach the nuclear option, which is to use your own computer. This will drive folks at your company nuts. Now you're transferring data from a secure machine to one which you use for personal e-mail, Facebook, sports, personal finance and other activities that we needn't dwell on here. This is an absolute last resort and the overheard of moving stuff from one device to another will obviate most of the efficiency gains that open source software will provide. Here's how to make it work: produce work that is ONLY POSSIBLE using R, or Python or any of the tools which we will discuss. Show a killer visual and then patiently explain to your boss why it can't be done in Excel and why you can't share it with other departments and why it can't be done every quarter. This is a tall order, but it just might get someone's attention.

Good luck! As always, please e-mail me with any questions.

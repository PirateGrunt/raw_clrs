I've created a package called `raw` for use with this workshop. The package contains data sets which should be of general interest to actuaries and make good illustrations. In addition, the package may be used to install other packages which you'll want.

To install it, enter this line at the R console:

```
install.packages("raw", dependencies = "Suggests")
```

The `raw` package comes with several data sets which will be used during the workshop. These are:

### COTOR - Committee on the Theory of Risk

These are four data sets- COTOR2, COTOR3, COTOR4, COTOR5 which have simulated loss amounts. COTOR2 and COTOR3 are simply vectors with losses. COTOR4 adds a claim number and year. COTOR5 has a risk code, year and geographical indicator.

### Hurricane 

The Hurricane data set contains latitude and longitude information for all storms recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. In addition to geographical data, wind speed and year are also recorded.

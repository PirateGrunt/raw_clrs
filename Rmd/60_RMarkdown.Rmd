## Review
* 10_GettingStarted
* 20_BasicData: variables, statistics, tables, 
* 30_Visualization: ggplots
* 40_ChainLadder: triangles, more plots
* 50_OtherReserving: triangles, more plots


## Reorganize 
*	Data import and cleaning: read.csv()
*	Data summary: summary()
*	Visualization: ggplot()
*	Chainladder:
*	Compare with other reserving: 

## Option A
1. Calculate the new objects, such as statistics, new variables, tables, graphs and etc.
2. Copy and paste in PowerPoint. 

## Option B

## Build our project
*	Data import and cleaning: read.csv()
*	Data summary: summary()
*	Visualization: ggplot()
*	Chainladder:
*	Compare with other reserving: 

## Data import and cleaning: read.csv()
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Data summary: summary()
```{echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Visualization: ggplot()
```
summary(cars)
```

## Chainladder:
```
summary(cars)
```

## Compare with other reserving: 
```
summary(cars)
```

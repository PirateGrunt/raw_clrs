R is a programming language, derived from S. Alright, so what's S then? S was developed as a way for analysts- primarily statisticians- to interact with FORTAN libraries. Way back when, if you wanted to construct a model, blah blah

R is an "open source" project, which means that its license entitles anyone to use the software, so long as they keep their use of the software "open". The specific licensing language may be found here: http://www.r-project.org/COPYING. One of the practical benefits of an open source project is that- similar to something like Wikipedia- users may contribute improvements and extensions to the project.

Information about R may be found at [www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/). Another great source for inspiration is http://www.r-bloggers.com/. Here, you'll see examples where R has been applied in dozens of different contexts. This is an aggregation of blogs from around the world and changes every day. It's always worth checking out. There are at least two R-focused blogs of interest to actuaries. The first is http://lamages.blogspot.com/ written by Markus Gesman in London. Markus works for Lloyds and is the original author of the ChainLadder package in R. Another, http://pirategrunt.com/, is written by me. This is where I write about stuff that interests me in a format where I needn't worry quite so much about how polished the verbiage and analysis is. I'll give the standard caveat that the views expressed on my blog do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, the CAS or anyone other than me.
